# Dotfiles

## Modes
* `local-fish` for my local machines running fish (tested on macOS). TODO: rename to mac-fish
* `portable-bash` for remote servers running bash, usually shared hosting
* `win10` for my local machines running Windows 10, including WSL

One less-obvious difference between the modes is I'm able to use Ag in my local environments, but instead use the more portable `ack` in `portable-bash` mode.

## Included modules
* `portable-bash` mode includes files that are not managed by a submodule/package/bundler and need to be updated manually:
    * ack (single-file version) from https://beyondgrep.com/install/
    * git-completion.bash from https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.bash
    * agnoster.bash from https://github.com/speedenator/agnoster-bash/blob/master/agnoster.bash
